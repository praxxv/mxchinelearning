so this was my first ever AI project . The model is an LSTM and aims at predicting hpi (house price index). The dataset was obtained from Texas A&M website and consisted of 3 columns - date, hpi, numsold
(number of houses sold in 1000s). The columns inflation rate, interest rate and gdp growth rate were added later on to create a multivariate LSTM instead of the traditional LSTM that relies only on time series
data. 
The model is hilghly accurate and uses a batch size of 12 months. The initial difference in actual and predicted values corresponds to the first 12 months in the initial learning phase of the LSTM before which 
there is no data available. The model is able to work very well after that.
