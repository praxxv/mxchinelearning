This has been my most prestigious project so far.It is a CNN that detects counterfeit banknotes. Currency counterfeiting has been a topic of interest to me for a while, this prompted me to create a project 
that could classify a banknote as real or fake. until now I had only worked with textual data but this was my introduction to image data as well. It was in this project that i saw the true power of 
deep learning. 
The project has two datasets stored and populated in drive. First I took a few photos of genuine banknotes from the internet and applied data augmentation to create transformations of these images to create
  thousands of copies (5000 total approximately). 
I then applied photo editing to some of the genuine photos to create counterfeits and applied image augmentation with the same transormations on these edited photos to create a dataset of approximately 5000
photos for the fake dataset. These were then fed to the CNN and resulted in an accurate model that is able to classify banknotes as real or genuine.
