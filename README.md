PROJECT 1 - HOUSE PRICE INDEX PREDICTION USING TIME SERIES DATA AND – MULTIVARIATE LSTM

The House Price Index (HPI) is a measure that tracks changes in the prices of residential properties over time. It provides insights into real estate market trends, showing whether home prices are rising or falling. The index is typically calculated using repeat sales data or hedonic regression models, and is used by policymakers, economists, investors, and homebuyers to assess housing market health, inflation, and investment potential. 

THIS IS THE FIRST PROJECT I HAVE MADE FOR MY PORTFOLIO. AT THE START OF THIS PROJECT I HAD NO EXPERIENCE WHATSOVER IN BUILDING ANY ML PROJECT. 
THE MODEL IS AN RNN-RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORK AND AIMS TO PREDICT HPI - HOUSE PRICE INDEX USING TIME SERIES DATA. THE DATASET WAS OBTAINED FROM THE TEXAS A&M WEBSITE AND CONSISTED OF THREE COLUMNS - DATE, HPI , AND NUMSOLD. THE DATE COLUMN WAS USED TO CREATE A TIME SERIES MODEL. THE HPI COLUMN WAS THE TARGET VARIABLE AND NUMSOLD IS THE NUMBER OF HOUSES IN 1000S SOLD THAT YEAR. I DID GO ON TO MODIFY THE DATASET BY ADDING MORE COLUMNS TO CREATE A MULTIVARIATE LSTM MODEL AS I BELIEVED THAT SIMPLY USING THE TIME SERIES DATA WOULD BE TOO SIMPLE. THE COLUMNS I WENT ON TO ADD AND POPULATE ARE – THE CORRESPONDING YEAR’S INFLATION RATE, INTEREST RATE AND GDP GROWTH RATE.
