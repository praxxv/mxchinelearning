Fake news is becoming an increasingly common threat. With the use of GenAI, it is becoming increasingly easier to create convincing news articles that are fake. The agent I have created is trained 
on a news article dataset with labels - fake and real via a huggingface frontier model and is easily and accurtely able to classify an article as fake or real. This classification is fed to gpt 4o mini which 
generates a brief response to a user on why the said model is fake or real. Through the project, a user just needs to paste a news article into the gradio interface after which the agent classifies the article as 
fake or real and provides a brief reasoning.
