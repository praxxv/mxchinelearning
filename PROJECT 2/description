Keystroke data such as hold time(the duration someone holds down a key while typing) and flight time(the difference between releasing one key and pressing the next) are unique biometric 
  characteristics to individuals. In this 
project, I have captured mine and my moms keystroke data to create a dataset using a python code. Then I went on to create a classification model that classifies keystroke data corresponding to me (label 1)
and my mom (label 0). The model involves several traditional models such as KNN, SVM, logistic regression, random forrest and a deep learning model using ANN as well.
Random forrest was proved to be the best classifier with 78% accuracy with ANN being the lowest at 66%.

  The following project has a large scope in the feild of biometrics and cybersecurity as keystroke data can be used as a distinctive security feature.
